## Definition

**Bounds** refer to the range or limits of values that are allowed for each dimension of the state space. Bounds are essential because they define the valid range of configurations that a robot or system can occupy. These bounds help ensure that generated states are within a permissible range, avoiding configurations that may lead to collisions or other issues.

***Bounds are external limits imposed on the internal system.***

1. **Dimension-Specific Boundaries:** Each dimension of the state space (e.g., joint angles, position coordinates) can have its own set of upper and lower bounds. These boundaries restrict the values that a state can take in that dimension.

2. **Example:** For a robotic arm with joint angles, the bounds for each joint angle might be specified as follows:
    - Joint 1: Minimum angle = -π/2, Maximum angle = π/2
    - Joint 2: Minimum angle = -π/4, Maximum angle = π/4
    - Joint 3: Minimum angle = -π/3, Maximum angle = π/3

3. **Validity Checking:** Bounds are used in conjunction with validity checking to determine whether a given state is valid. If a state falls within the specified bounds and doesn't violate any other constraints (e.g., collision-free), it is considered valid. Otherwise, it's invalid.

4. **Sampling:** When sampling new states in a state space (as part of motion planning algorithms), the bounds play a crucial role. Random samples are generated within the bounds of each dimension to ensure that the sampled state is within the permissible range.

5. **Path Constraints:** Bounds also affect the trajectories or paths generated by motion planning algorithms. The paths need to stay within the bounds to ensure that they are physically feasible and safe.
   
6. **Customization:** Depending on the specific robotic system and motion planning problem, you can define custom bounds for each dimension of the state space. These bounds should reflect the physical limits and constraints of the system.

7. **Boundary Handling:** How the state space handles states that reach or exceed the bounds can vary. Some systems wrap around (e.g., circular joints), while others might clamp the values to the nearest boundary.
