## Definition
**Path** represents a sequence of states or configurations that describe a valid and collision-free trajectory or motion for a robotic system or entity in the configuration space (C-space). OMPL is indeed flexible and allows users to define and work with paths in various ways to accommodate different motion planning scenarios and requirements.

1. **State Space:** Paths in OMPL are defined within the context of a specific state space. The state space describes the possible configurations (states) that the robot or system can occupy. OMPL provides support for various state spaces, including Euclidean spaces, SE2, SE3, and custom state spaces tailored to specific robot models.

2. **Path Representation:** Paths in OMPL are typically represented as sequences of states. Each state in the path corresponds to a valid configuration of the robot in the C-space. The path starts from an initial state and ends at a goal state.

3. **Path Quality:** The quality of a path can vary depending on the optimization criteria defined by the user or specified via an `OptimizationObjective`. Paths can be optimized for criteria such as path length, clearance from obstacles, or smoothness.

4. **Path Validation:** OMPL provides tools to validate paths for collision avoidance and other constraints. A path validity checker ensures that all states along the path are collision-free and satisfy any user-defined constraints.

5. **Multi-Modal Paths:** In some motion planning problems, there may be multiple paths that lead from the initial state to the goal state. OMPL supports multi-modal planning, allowing the generation and management of multiple alternative paths.

6. **Path Manipulation:** OMPL offers functions and utilities for manipulating paths. You can interpolate or smooth paths to improve their quality or modify them as needed.
  
7. **Path Output:** Once a motion planning algorithm completes its work, it typically outputs one or more paths that represent feasible solutions to the problem. Users can access these paths for further analysis or execution.
