## Definition 

**Projection evaluator** is a component used in motion planning to map or project a state from a high-dimensional state space into a lower-dimensional subspace. This projection is often used to simplify the motion planning problem and make it more tractable by reducing the dimensionality of the problem while preserving essential information.

1. **High-Dimensional State Space:** In many robotic motion planning problems, the state space can be high-dimensional, representing various degrees of freedom and parameters for the robot. High-dimensional spaces can be challenging to search efficiently.

2. **Projection:** A projection evaluator defines a mapping or projection function that takes a high-dimensional state as input and produces a lower-dimensional representation of that state. This lower-dimensional representation is often referred to as the "projected state" or "projection."

3. **Dimension Reduction:** The purpose of the projection is to reduce the dimensionality of the state space while retaining the most relevant information for motion planning. By focusing on a lower-dimensional subspace, planners can explore the space more efficiently.

4. **Collision Checking:** Projection evaluators are often used in collision checking. The projected state can be checked for collisions more easily and quickly than the full high-dimensional state. If the projected state is collision-free, it is more likely that the original high-dimensional state is also collision-free.
   
5. **Customization:** OMPL allows users to define custom projection evaluators that are tailored to the specific characteristics of their motion planning problems. This flexibility allows you to choose the most suitable projection for your application.
   
6. **Planning Efficiency:** Effective projection can lead to more efficient and faster motion planning, especially in complex and high-dimensional state spaces.

7. **Balancing Information Loss:** While projection reduces dimensionality, it's important to strike a balance between dimension reduction and information loss. Projection evaluators should be designed to retain relevant information for the planning problem.
