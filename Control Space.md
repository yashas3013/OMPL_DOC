## Definition

**Control Space** is a representation of the control space for a robotic system or an entity. The control space defines the space of all possible control inputs or commands that can be applied to the system to influence its motion. Control spaces are essential for planning the trajectories or paths of dynamic systems, such as robots or autonomous vehicles, where continuous control inputs are involved.

Here are key points to understand about the ControlSpace in OMPL:

1. **Definition of Control Space:** The ControlSpace in OMPL provides a way to specify the possible control inputs that can be applied to a robotic system. These control inputs can include velocities, accelerations, torques, or other commands that affect the system's dynamics.
    
2. **Configuration and Control Spaces:** OMPL distinguishes between the configuration space (C-space) and the control space. The C-space represents the set of all possible configurations or states of the system, while the control space represents the set of all possible control inputs.
    
3. **Dimensionality:** Control spaces can have a dimensionality that depends on the number of control inputs required to control the system. For example, in a simple car-like robot, the control space might include two dimensions: linear velocity and angular velocity.
    
4. **Customization:** OMPL allows users to define custom control spaces that match the dynamics and control capabilities of their specific robotic systems. Customization includes specifying the dimensionality, bounds on control inputs, and other characteristics of the control space.
    
5. **Integration with Planners:** Control spaces are typically used in conjunction with OMPL's motion planning algorithms that support control-based planning. These algorithms search for trajectories or paths in both the C-space and the control space to guide the system from a start configuration to a goal configuration while satisfying motion constraints.
    
6. **Feedback Control:** Control spaces are particularly useful for systems that require continuous feedback control. Algorithms in OMPL can generate sequences of control inputs that guide the system along planned paths, taking into account dynamics and control constraints.


## Example 

A differential drive robot. it has 2 wheels thus control of the bot can be done by considering the deferential drive equations.
While also defining limits of the system like max speed etc.


## How does Control Space affects State samplers?

Control-based motion planning algorithms in OMPL operate by sampling both control inputs from the control space and states from the state space. Here's how the control space influences state space sampling in OMPL

1. **Sequential Sampling:** In control-based planning, the process of generating a trajectory or path from a start state to a goal state is typically a sequential one. It involves selecting a sequence of control inputs and propagating the system's state accordingly. Each control input results in a transition to a new state.

2. **Control Input Sampling:** Sampling control inputs from the control space is often one of the initial steps. These control inputs can be sampled randomly, systematically, or using specialized strategies. The choice of control inputs can influence the quality of trajectories generated by the planner.

3. **State Propagation:** After control inputs are sampled, they are applied to the current state to determine the next state. This state propagation process depends on the system's dynamics model, which relates control inputs to state changes. OMPL provides support for modeling different types of systems and dynamics.

4. **State Validation:** Each newly generated state is checked for validity using a state validity checker. This checker evaluates whether the state complies with constraints, such as collision avoidance, and other user-defined criteria.

5. **Exploration and Iteration:** The control space and the choice of control inputs also influence the exploration strategy. Control-based planners may adapt their exploration strategies based on the effectiveness of previously sampled control inputs and the resulting state transitions. This adaptability can influence how the state space is explored.

6. **Trajectory Optimization:** Some control-based planners in OMPL may perform trajectory optimization, where the sequence of control inputs is iteratively adjusted to improve the quality of the generated trajectory. Optimization can lead to adjustments in both control input and state space sampling.


## Summary

Control Space is defined so that planners know what kind of system the problem is for.
Certainly walking up for a wheel chair is impossible. XD
