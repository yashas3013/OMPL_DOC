## Definition

**Optimization Objective** is a fundamental component used in motion planning to guide and evaluate the quality of motion plans, paths, or trajectories generated by motion planning algorithms. The `OptimizationObjective` provides a way to express the optimization criteria or goals of a motion planning problem, allowing planners to find paths that are optimized according to specific objectives. It helps balance trade-offs in various aspects of motion planning, such as path length, smoothness, or clearance from obstacles.

Here are the key features and functions of an `OptimizationObjective` in OMPL:

1. **Objective Function:** An `OptimizationObjective` defines an objective function that quantifies the quality of a motion plan based on certain criteria. This objective function assigns a cost or value to each motion plan, where lower values typically indicate better plans. The specific criteria depend on the optimization problem's goals.
    
2. **Objective Type:** OMPL provides different types of optimization objectives, including:
    
    - **Path Length:** Minimize the length of the path or trajectory.
    - **Path Clearance:** Maximize the clearance or distance between the path and obstacles.
    - **Smoothness:** Minimize the change in control inputs (for control-based planners) or path curvature.
    - **Efficiency:** Balance trade-offs between path length and clearance.
    - Custom Objectives: You can define custom optimization objectives based on your specific problem requirements.
3. **Weighted Objectives:** Many optimization objectives in OMPL allow you to assign weights to different criteria to emphasize or de-emphasize certain aspects of the optimization. For example, you can give higher weight to path clearance or path smoothness, depending on the application.
    
4. **Scoring Motion Plans:** An `OptimizationObjective` is used to score or evaluate motion plans, paths, or trajectories generated by motion planning algorithms. The planner seeks paths that minimize the cost according to the objective function.
    
5. **Multi-Objective Planning:** In some cases, you may want to optimize multiple criteria simultaneously, leading to multi-objective planning. OMPL allows you to specify multiple optimization objectives and search for Pareto-optimal solutions that balance multiple objectives.
