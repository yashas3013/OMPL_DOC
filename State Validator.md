## Definition

**State validator** is a component used in motion planning to determine whether a given state is valid or invalid within the context of a specific motion planning problem. The primary purpose of a state validator is to check whether a state in the configuration space (C-space) of a robotic system or an entity complies with the constraints and requirements of the planning problem.

Here's how a state validator works and its role in motion planning:

1. **State Space and Configuration Space (C-space):** In motion planning, the state space represents all possible configurations or states of a robot or system. The configuration space, often denoted as C-space, is a subset of the state space that considers only the valid and feasible configurations.
    
2. **State Validation:** A state validator is responsible for evaluating whether a given state, typically represented as a configuration in the state space, is valid or not. Validation involves checking various criteria, such as collision avoidance, adherence to joint limits, and satisfaction of other constraints.

3. **Collision Checking:** One of the most common uses of a state validator is collision checking. It determines whether the robot or system would collide with obstacles in its environment if placed in the given state. Collision checking helps ensure that planned paths and trajectories avoid collisions.

4. **Constraint Satisfaction:** Depending on the problem, a state validator may also check other constraints, such as joint limit constraints, kinematic constraints, dynamic constraints, and any task-specific requirements.

5. **Feedback to Motion Planner:** When a motion planner generates a path or trajectory, it checks each state along the path using the state validator. If a state is found to be invalid (e.g., due to collision), the motion planner can use this feedback to adjust the path or generate an alternative path.

6. **Customization:** OMPL allows users to define custom state validators that are tailored to their specific motion planning problems. This flexibility allows you to define validation criteria that match the characteristics of your robotic system and its environment.
